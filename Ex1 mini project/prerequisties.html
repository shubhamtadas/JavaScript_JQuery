<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>To learn JavaScript, you must know the basics of HTML and CSS,
  both of which are extremely easy to learn. For a working knowledge
 of JavaScript and most web-based projects, this knowledge will be
 sufficient. For more advanced projects and skills, it is recommended
to know basic OOP concepts and an OOP based programming language
(like Java).</p>

<p>You can install an IDE or use code editors, or even use notepad or
   Textpad to write JS code. IDEs and editors provide intuitive
   programming experience and faster results than programming with
   editors like notepad, where you have to type everything from
   scratch.</p>
