<h1 style="font-size:45px;">Variables Scope </h1>
<p>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.<br>

JavaScript has 3 types of scope:<br>

Block scope <br>
Function scope <br>
Global scope</p>
<p>Block Scope <br>
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.<br>

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.<br>

These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Local Scope <br>
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.</p>
<p>Function Scope <br>
JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.<br>

Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.<br>

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.</p>
