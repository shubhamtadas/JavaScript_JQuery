<p>
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
 It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
  (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
   objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
   them.</p>
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array
  , Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as ope
  rators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
   extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
  objects.</p>
